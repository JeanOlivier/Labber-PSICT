Pulse-Sequence Instrument Control Tools (PSICT)
===============================================

About
-----

The Pulse-Sequence Instrument Control Tools (PSICT) package is a Python module
designed to facilitate programmatic, script-based control over experiments
using `Labber`_. It is specifically designed for use with the Single-Qubit
Pulse Generator driver (amongst others), but functions with any instruments
that can be controlled via the Labber interface.

The PSICT-UIF (Unified Interface Framework) is the primary tool in this module,
directly responsible for providing a convenient interface between user scripts
and Labber. Additional tools in this module include a higher-level automation
class, virtual instrument drivers for use with Labber, and examples of user
scripts to showcase PSICT in action.

The latest version of PSICT can be found on the `repository`_. If you
are reading this document in pdf format, it has been generated from the README
file in the repository root. If you desire to read this document in a pdf
format, it can be found under ``docs/README.pdf``.

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version numbers indicate latest compatible version. Backwards compatibility is
thus not guaranteed. If backwards compatibility is required, please `create an
issue`_.

* Python 3.6.8+ (not tested with 3.7)
* Labber, as well as the ``Labber`` python API (``1.6.3``)
* ``numpy`` (``1.16.2``)
* ``h5py`` (``2.9.0``)

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently, the only available means is directly from the
`repository`_. Clone or download the repository and add to your
import path. To test, run the follwing in a Python prompt or script:

::

  import PSICT_UIF
  PSICT_UIF.__version__

We are planning to release this package via a Python distribution platform
(``pip`` or Anaconda), and that will be done as soon as all the kinks are
ironed out. Stay tuned!

Using the PSICT-UIF with Labber
-------------------------------

*Please note: the full documentation is still very much under construction.
Please contact the devs directly if you need assistance with specific
functionality!*

The PSICT-UIF is designed to be used with Labber through a 'worker script',
written and executed by the user. Various PSICT-UIF methods in the worker
script will set the values (including iterations and relations) of instrument
parameters, invoke Labber to actually carry out the desired experiment, and do
administrative tasks such as copying scripts and additional files for
record-keeping. The basics of the tasks and relationships are shown in Figure
1. More intricate use cases are described in the documentation.

Unfortunately, even basic usage is a bit too complex to describe in a humble
readme file. Thus, the content here is provided merely as an
introduction/overview, and a more complete explanation of how to actually go
about using PSICT and the PSICT-UIF with Labber must be outsourced to the
documentation.

There are several advantages to using a script-based approach to running
experiments (as compared to the Labber GUI). However, the biggest advantage
(and in fact the reason for PSICT's existence in the first place) is centered
around the design of the SQPG driver (or in general, any pulse-sequence
generation driver that aims to provide *full control over every pulse parameter
canonically within the Labber framework*).

Briefly, the emphasized requirement results in each pulse being implemented
'statically' in the driver, resulting in channel names which are fixed by the
position of the pulse within the sequence, and are not related to the function
of the pulse itself. For example, the amplitude of the second pulse in the
sequence will always be named ``Amplitude #2``, regardless of whether pulse 2
is serving the function of a readout, trigger, qubit excitation, etc. The
PSICT-UIF was created to remedy this, allowing the user to have more idiomatic
control and understanding of pulse parameters. As a happy consequence, this
also makes re-arranging existing pulses for new or modified sequences a trivial
task (which is not the case when using the Labber GUI), as well as providing
motivation for all the other good features that are now present in PSICT.

   running a single experiment. Cyan groups highlight input and output files.
   Note that, in principle, any appropriate drivers and instruments can be
   substituted or added to those shown; the diagram lists the most common
   examples for the purpose of illustration.


Additional modules in PSICT
---------------------------

Here, we provide a brief overview of the roles and capabilities of additional
modules/classes/etc that are provided as part of the PSICT package, but are not
part of the core PSICT-UIF functionality.

For more in-depth guides and descriptions, please see the full documentation.

WorkerScriptManager
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``WorkerScriptManager`` class is designed to be used in 'master' scripts,
i.e. scripts controlling and running multiple experiments in series.
Importantly, analysis of results can be interspersed with experiment execution,
allowing automated feedback without the need for user intervention.

The guiding design principle of the ``WorkerScriptManager``-enabled 'master'
scripts is the ability to seamlessly switch between running multiple
experiments with a master script and single experiments with a worker script,
with all parameter values updated automatically (if done right). The
PSICT/Labber hierarchy (and how the layers interact with each other) is
explained in more detail in the full documentation.

PSICT MultiPulse
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``MultiPulse`` is a virtual instrument driver for Labber, aimed at creating
pulse sequences that are longer than those allowed by drivers such as the SQPG.
In principle, pulse sequences of arbitrary length (in terms of number of
pulses) can be generated; however, the trade-off is the loss of control over
individual pulse parameters within the Labber interface. It is extremely
well-suited for applications such as randomized benchmarking, where a large
number of random permutations of pulses are selected from a small, predefined
set.

Development
-----------

Releases
^^^^^^^^

Two primary branches are available on the repository: 

* ``master`` is the latest stable release, currently ``1.2``.
* ``dev`` tracks more experimental features which have been tested to some
  degree, currently ``1.3dev0.1``. 

For a specific release version, please find the
appropriate tag in the repository history.

Features in development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``1.3`` *planned features*

* Full documentation!
* Copying additional files on measurement to be included in the UIF [#6].
* Make MultiPulse pulse generation more efficient for very long pulse
  sequences by pre-calculating envelopes and modulation signals [#7].

``2.0`` *planned features*

* Overhaul of the SQPG/pulse-parameter-specification backend to allow more
  direct interfacing with the SQPG and Labber. Amongst numerous fundamental
  benefits in terms of simplifying the encoding of convoluted pulse sequences
  in the worker scripts, doing this will also allow the ``Spacing`` parameter
  to be used directly as an iteration variable [#5].
