'''
This is the rc (resources) file for additional definitions required by the Labber-PSICT library.

It defines the quantities that the PSICT-UIF interface works with in a way that they are not hard-coded into the "procedural" code, but can in principle be changed for different scripts and so on.

Note that there are other rc files that are part of the PSICT-UIF package; these contain all the "permanent" definitions and values which do not change from script to script.

The key difference is as follows:
 - If this rc file is not set up correctly, the code will run but the output may be nonsensical.
 - If the package rc files are not set up correctly, the code may fail to run.

This file may be copied alongside the script in future PSICT releases.
